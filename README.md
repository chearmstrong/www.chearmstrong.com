This is the repo for my personal static site, built using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the [Dimension](https://github.com/ChangoMan/gatsby-starter-dimension) starter.

This is very much a work in progress - I wanted to know a little more about Gatsby, React and CirlcleCI. ðŸ¤“

## Developing ðŸ’»

Run `yarn develop` in the terminal to start the dev site and browse to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Building ðŸ“¦

Run `yarn build`.

## Deploying ðŸš€

The site is hosted in AWS S3, and deployed automatically from `master` using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).

Run `yarn deploy`.
