# www.chearmstrong.com ðŸ‘·

This is the repo for my personal static site, built using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the [Dimension](https://github.com/ChangoMan/gatsby-starter-dimension) starter.

I'm also using [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for my site's content.

This is very much a work in progress - I want to know more about Gatsby, React and ~CirlcleCI~ GitHub Actions. ðŸ¤“

## Developing ðŸ’»

Run `yarn develop` in the terminal to start the dev site and browse to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Building ðŸ“¦

Run `yarn build`.

## Deploying ðŸš€

The site is hosted in AWS S3, and deployed automatically using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/chearmstrong/www.chearmstrong.com/actions), with a push to `master` or when content is updated at Contentful (triggered by a webhook).

Locally, run `yarn deploy`.
